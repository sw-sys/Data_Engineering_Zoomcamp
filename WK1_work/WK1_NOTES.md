**Video Notes:**
- Data pipeline is a fancy name for process that inputs data, transforms it, outputs more data e.g. csv > Python transfomation > table in postgres
- Docker - one computer can host many containers holding OS, libraries, ELTs. this means you can run db's in complete isolation/avoid conflict similar to envs. 
- Advantages of Docker = fast reproducability, can run local experiments testing (to ensure behaviour consistant/integration tests), integration, running pipelines in the cloud by porting image/serverless, can use in conjunction with Spark.
- It's possible to set up a container (e.g. python:3.9) but use a dockerfile to config what to do automatically e.g. FROM container, RUN a pip install, specify a WORKDIR, use ENTRYPOINT
- use sys & argv to pass the file [0] then arguments [1] like dates
- can use variables specified as args to return status updates
