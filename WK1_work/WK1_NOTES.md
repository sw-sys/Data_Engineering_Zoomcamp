# Week 1: Introduction & Prerequisites

Tech: Docker, Postgres, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Terraform

---

### **Focus**: Week 1 is dedicated to setting up the key tools and technologies youâ€™ll be using throughout the course.

**Video Notes:**
- Data pipeline is a fancy name for process that inputs data, transforms it, outputs more data e.g. csv > Python transfomation > table in postgres
- Docker - one computer can host many containers holding OS, libraries, ELTs. this means you can run db's in complete isolation/avoid conflict similar to envs. 
- Advantages of Docker = fast reproducability, can run local experiments testing (to ensure behaviour consistant/integration tests), integration, running pipelines in the cloud by porting image/serverless, can use in conjunction with Spark.
